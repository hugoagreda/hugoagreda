# Hugo Agreda

AI & Big Data student focused on building digital infrastructure, automation systems
and data-driven tools.

I work mainly with backend systems, internal platforms and workflows where data,
automation and reliability matter.

## About me

I’m currently developing my technical profile in **AI & Big Data**, with a strong focus on
**Python, SQL and data processing**, applying what I learn through practical projects.

My main interest lies in how **data, automation and machine learning** can be used to
improve processes, decision-making and internal operations in real businesses.

Alongside my studies, I’m building and maintaining systems such as CRMs, web platforms
and automation workflows. Some of these projects are private due to business
confidentiality.

Before moving fully into tech, I worked in operational and coordination roles, where I
developed a structured mindset, problem-solving under pressure and responsibility for
real outcomes. That background strongly influences how I approach software today:
practical, organized and system-oriented.
